# RefactoringByMartinFowler
Chapter I example code of the amazing `[Martin Fowler's refactoring guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/refactoring-improving-the/9780134757681/)` book

## Purpose
While reading first chapter of the refactoring guide, I quickly wanted to put my hands on concrete code to get a better understanding of the `compile-test-commit` cycles.
I set up this repo to share my step-by-step refactoring following chapter I walkthrough.
